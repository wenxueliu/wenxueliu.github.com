##MAC 地址
MAC（Medium/MediaAccess Control,介质访问控制）MAC地址是收录在NetworkInterfaceCard(网卡,NIC)里的.MAC地址,也叫硬件地址,是由48比特/bit长（6字节/byte，1byte=8bits），16进制的数字组成。其中，前三个字节是由IEEE的注册管理机构RA负责给不同厂家分配的代码(高位24位)，也称为“编制上唯一的标识符”（Organizationally Unique Identifier)，后三个字节(低位24位)由各厂家自行指派给生产的适配器接口，称为扩展标识符（唯一性）。

ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff则作为廣播位址。
01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx是多播地址，01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx是IPv4多播地址。

其中第1字节的第8Bit（如图中00-50-BA-...对应的0000000-01010000-10111010-...，加粗字体的Bit）标识这个地址是组播地址还是单播地址。这是由以太网的传输协议高字节先传，但每一字节内低位先传的特性所决定的，见IEEE 802.3 3.2.3 Address fields： “The first bit (LSB) shall be used in the Destination Address field as an address type designation bit to identify the Destination Address either as an individual or as a group address. If this bit is 0, it shall indicate that the address field contains an individual address. If this bit is 1, it shall indicate that the address field contains a group address that identifies none, one or more, or all of the stations connected to the LAN. In the Source Address field, the first bit is reserved and set to 0.”。事实上这传输的顺序为000000000000101001011101...“The first bit (LSB)”即是前言的第8Bit。



###IP 地址与 MAC 地址区别

IP地址和MAC地址相同点是它们都唯一，不同的特点主要有：
1. 对于网络上的某一设备，如一台计算机或一台路由器，其IP地址可变（但必须唯一），而MAC地址是不可变。我们可以根据需要给一台主机指定任意的IP地址，如我们可以给局域网上的某台计算机分配IP地址为192.168.0.112 ，也可以将它改成192.168.0.200。而任一网络设备（如网卡，路由器）一旦生产出来以后，其MAC地址不可由本地连接内的配置进行修改。
2. 长度不同。IP地址为32位，MAC地址为48位。
3. 分配依据不同。IP地址的分配是基于网络拓扑，MAC地址的分配是基于制造商。
4. 寻址协议层不同。IP地址应用于OSI第三层，即网络层，而MAC地址应用在OSI第二层，即数据链路层。 数据链路层协议可以使数据从一个节点传递到相同链路的另一个节点上（通过MAC地址），而网络层协议使数据可以从一个网络传递到另一个网络上（ARP根据目的IP地址，找到中间节点的MAC地址，通过中间节点传送，从而最终到达目的网络）

Just like there are 3 different Ethernet header types, there are also 3 different types of Ethernet addresses:

    Unicast
    Broadcast
    Multicast

A unicast frame contains the unique MAC address of the destination receiver. A broadcast frame contains all binary 1’s as the destination address (FFFF.FFFF.FFFF). A multicast frame contains the unique multicast MAC address of an application, protocol, or datastream.

Why is it important to be able to distinguish between the 3 types of Ethernet address type? In an Ethernet switch, each of the three are treated differently.

A unicast addressed frame is only sent out the specific port leading to the receiver. A broadcast frame is flooded out all ports. A multicast addressed frame is either flooded out all ports (if no multicast optimization is configured) or sent out only the ports interested in receiving the traffic.

It’s easy for the ethernet switch to identify a broadcast frame because there is only one universally known broadcast address, FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (all binary ones). Therefore it is easy for the switch to know these frames need to be flooded out all ports.

However, given there is such a wide variety of possible unicast and multicast Ethernet addresses, how does the switch distinguish between the two? It is important to properly make the distinction because the the two are handled so differently within the switch (a unicast frames goes to only one port, a multicast frame goes to some or all ports).

Does the switch have a database of all possible multicast MAC addresses it references for each frame? No, that would be inefficient.

How this is done efficiently is there is one specific bit in a Ethernet MAC address that signifies if the frame is unicast or multicast. The switch need only look at this one bit to make the distinction.

The IEEE has specified that the most significant bit of the most significant byte be used for this purpose. If it‘s a 1, that means multicast, 0 means unicast. The most significant byte is the left most byte in the address, and the most significant bit is the right most bit of the byte (this is counter intuitive to most binary implementations where the left most bit usually labeled most significant). 

      Most Significant                                             Least Significant                                                                  
       | 1st Byte  |  2nd Byte   |  3rd Byte  |  4th Byte  |  5th Byte  |  6th Byte  |   
       |          OUI                     |           Vendor-Assigned          |

                           U/L I/G
      1st Byte |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
              least           most 
            significant    significant
               bit            bit


Some quick examples of mulicast MAC addresses:

    0100.CCCC.DDDD
    0900.AAAA.BBBB

Some quick examples of unicast MAC addresses:

    0001.4455.6677
    0800.2233.4455

Each of the bolded numbers represents a 1 or 0 present in the most significant bit of the most significant byte.

This bit is also referred to as the Individual/Group bit.

From the perspective of an Ethernet hub device, none of this matters, as all frames are flooded out all ports regardless of their address being unicast, broadcast, or multicast. It makes no sense for an Ethernet hub to distinguish between the three.
