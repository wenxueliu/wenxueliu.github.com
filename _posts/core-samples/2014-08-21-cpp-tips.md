####How to convert int to string
    std::string name = "John"; int age = 21;
    std::string result;

1 Boost

	result = name + boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(age).
	
	is safe, but slow; requires Boost (header-only); most/all platforms

2 FastFormat.Format

	fastformat::fmt(result, "{0}{1}", name, age);

	is safe, and fast; requires FastFormat, which must be compiled; most/all platforms
	 
3 FastFormat.Write
	
	fastformat::write(result, name, age);
	
	is safe, and fast; requires FastFormat, which must be compiled; most/all platforms

4 IOStreams

	std::stringstream sstm;
	sstm << name << age;
	result = sstm.str();

	
    safe, slow, and verbose; requires nothing (is standard C++)

5 itoa

	char numstr[21]; // enough to hold all numbers up to 64-bits
	result = name + itoa(age, numstr, 10);

	is brittle (you must supply a large enough buffer), fast, and verbose; itoa() is a non-standard extension, and not guaranteed to be available for all platforms


6 sprintf

	char numstr[21]; // enough to hold all numbers up to 64-bits
	sprintf(numstr, "%d", age);
	result = name + numstr;
	
	is brittle (you must supply a large enough buffer), fast, and verbose; requires nothing (is standard C++); all platforms

7 STLSoft's integer_to_string

	char numstr[21]; // enough to hold all numbers up to 64-bits
	result = name + stlsoft::integer_to_string(numstr, 21, age);
	
	is brittle (you must supply a large enough buffer), probably the fastest-possible conversion, verbose; requires STLSoft (header-only); most/all platforms

8 STLSoft's winstl::int_to_string()

	result = name + winstl::int_to_string(age);

	safe-ish (you don't use more than one int_to_string() call in a single statement), fast; requires STLSoft (header-only); Windows-only
   
9 Poco NumberFormatter

	result = name + Poco::NumberFormatter().format(age);

    is safe, but slow; requires Poco C++ ; most/all platforms
